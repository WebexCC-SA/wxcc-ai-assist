## Feature Description

Customers find it frustrating to repeat themselves, especially after a call drop. Now, agents can pick up where the call left off, reducing frustration and handling time, while empowering agents to work more efficiently.

The Cisco AI Assistant provides a summary of the recently dropped interaction, detailing the reason for the call and the last action discussed. This enables agents to seamlessly resume the conversation.

## Mission Details

Understand the provisioning process and Control Hub settings required to activate this AI feature. Review the agent configurations with the correct desktop layout. Test the feature.
