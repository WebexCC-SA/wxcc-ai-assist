## Build

### Task 1. Create Service and AI Agent Flow in Webex Connect. 

1. From Control Hub, go to **Contact Center** and open up **Webex Connect** Portal. 
    ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.9.gif)



2. Create new Service with name **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_2000_Service">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_2000_Service<span   class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**
    ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.10.gif)


3. Click on **Flows** and create new flow with the name ***Create_Ordedr_Flowers***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Create_Ordedr_Flowers"><span class="copy"></span></span>.

    ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.11.gif)

4. From the Integrations list select AI Agent. 
    ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.12.gif)

5. For now, save the flow and **Make it live**. We will return to configuring this flow later. Creating it now is necessary to complete configurations in the AI Studio Portal.
    ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.13.gif)

### Task 2. Configure Action in the AI Studio.

1. If not logged-in in AI Agent Studio, login to the AI Studio Portal.

      "status": "Type",
      "phoneNumber": "Type"
    }
    ```

3. Then click on **Parse** and **Save** the change.
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.62.gif)

4. Drag and drop **HTTP Request** node from the left side of the Webex Connect Flow Builder. Connect **AI Agent** block to the **HTTP Request** block. 
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.27.gif)


5. Open up HTTP Request node and configure it with the following HTTP Request: <br>

    > Method: **POST**
    > <br>
    > Endpoint URL: ***https://67e9aa0bbdcaa2b7f5b9ed62.mockapi.io/customerOrder***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="https://        > 67e9aa0bbdcaa2b7f5b9ed62.mockapi.io/customerOrder"><span class="copy"></span></span><br>
    > Header: ***Content-Type***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Content-Type"><span class="copy"></span></span>: ***application/ json***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="application/json"><span class="copy"></span></span>

    >       {
    >        "orderDetails": "$(n2.aiAgent.orderDetails)",
    >        "orderTotal": "$(n2.aiAgent.orderTotal)",
    >        "delivery": "$(n2.aiAgent.delivery)",
    >        "address": "$(n2.aiAgent.address)",
    >        "status": "$(n2.aiAgent.status)",
    >        "phoneNumber": "$(n2.aiAgent.phoneNumber)"
    >       }
    >       ```   
    > <br>
    > 
    > Output Variable Type: <b>JSON</b><br>
    > Click on **+Add Variable**<br>
    > Output Variable Name: ***orderNumber***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="orderNumber"><span class="copy"></span></span><br>

7. Save changies and click on **Make Live**.
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.32.gif)

### Task 4. Deliver data from Webex Connect to AI studio for the response to the customer. 

1. <span style="color: red;">[Read Only]</span> Once the HTTP request is completed a new object will be created on the third pary application. You can see all object by using the this link [https://67e9aa0bbdcaa2b7f5b9ed62.mockapi.io/customerOrder](https://67e9aa0bbdcaa2b7f5b9ed62.mockapi.io/customerOrder){:target="_blank"}. Below you can see the screenshot with all order informations. Currently there are only 2, but by the time of this lab there could be more.
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.64.png)
Each order/object will contain all the information that we sent from AI Studio but one - id. This key is created automatically once we create the object. The goal of this Task is to send the value of the **id** back to the AI Agent so AI Agent can provide it to the customer while they are still in live contact, like you can see on the picture below.<br>
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.31.png)

2. <span style="color: red;">[Read Only]</span> When you were configuring HTTP Request in your previous Task, on the bottom of the request you were configuring the Output Variable. This variable will be used to parse the unique order **id** and pass the value to the Output Variable with name **orderNumber**. See the screenshot below. In the next step we will be configuring this orderNumber variable to be sent to Webex AI studio.</br>
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.65.png)

3. While on your Webex Connect flow, click on **Edit** the flow then click on the **Settings** and on the top select **Flow Outcomes** and expand **Last Execution Status**. In the **Define key-value pairs to be sent to the AI Agent** select **Enter JSON**.
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.66.gif)

4. We need to add the key-value pair to the existing JSON body. Add the comma after the last pair and insert ***"orderNumber": "$(n3.orderNumber)"***. Make sure there is no comma after the pair that you inserted. Then click on **Save**.
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.37.png) <br>
   <br>
Also see this change in action below. 
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.38.gif)

5. Click on **Make Live** to publish the flow. 
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.67.gif)

### Task 5. Configure SMS confirmation. 

1. If it is not open, navigate to **Webex Connect** portal. Find your Service **<span class="attendee-id-container"><span class="attendee-id-placeholder" data-suffix="_2000_Service">Your_Attendee_ID</span>_2000_Service<span   class="copy" title="Click to copy!"></span></span>**, navigate to the flow and click on **Manage** the flow. 
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.39.gif)


2. On the right top click on **Edit**. Then from the available Utilities on the left side find the **SMS** and drag and drop the block to the flow. Connect **HTTP Request** node to the **SMS** node. 
   ![Profiles](../graphics/Lab1_AI_Agent/2.68.gif)

3. Double click on the SMS block and configure the following:

     > Destination: ***$(n2.aiAgent.phoneNumber)***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="$(n2.aiAgent.phoneNumber)"><span class="copy"></span></span><br>
     > From Number: ***12066478712***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="12066478712"><span class="copy"></span></span><br>
     >Message Type: **Text**<br>
     ><br>
     >Message as below:<br>
     ><br>
     ><b>Here is your order details:<br>
     >orderNumber: "$(n3.orderNumber)"<br>
     >orderDetails: "$(n2.aiAgent.orderDetails)"<br>
     >orderTotal: "$(n2.aiAgent.orderTotal)"<br>
     >delivery: "$(n2.aiAgent.delivery)"<br>
     >address: "$(n2.aiAgent.address)"<br>
     >status: "$(n2.aiAgent.status)"<br>
