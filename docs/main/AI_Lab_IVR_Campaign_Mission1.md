7. Click on **Field mappings**. This settings refer to the process of uploading a template or sample data and mapping the headers with the headers of dialer system. When you create a campaign, you have to assign the field mappings to a campaign and appropriate contact list has to be uploaded. When you upload a contact list to a campaign, and if the headers of the field mappings do not match, then you will get an error.

8. For this lab, **Field Mapping** is preconfigured. However, it is important for you to understand that, during the creation of the field mapping, we assigned the Global Variables to match the headers of the file you will be uploading when managing the campaign list.

8. Click on **Global Variable**. These attributes are configured in the control hub application. Webex Campaign will receive these variables from control hub application. At least one variable has to be made a customer unique identifier.

9. Click on **Purpose meta-tags**. This feature provides a way to separate and maintain the type of campaigns; a user can set up for particular business requirements. During campaign activation, you can tag the campaign with one or more purposes. This allows the enterprise to analyze what type of campaigns they are creating through the platform and helps to maintain a ‘balanced diet’ of communications for contacts.

10. Click on **P&L meta-tags**. This section allows a business to assign a campaign to different divisions, cost centers, or products. For instance, an organization might set up different P&Ls for departments.

11. Click on **SFTP configurations**. This section allows you to add SFTP connection details that can be used to access the contact list over SFTP connections.

12. Click on **Telephony outcome settings**. These settings refer to the configurations that help define and track the results of calls. These options are configured in the dialer. Webex campaign will receive these outcomes from dialer. They allow businesses to categorize and record the outcome of each call made to a customer. You can edit the outcome to suit your business use case. For example, if the dialer records the outcome as Busy and Close contact - Yes ( do not attempt to call again) can be overwritten in Webex campaign to Close contact - No ( make an attempt to call again).
